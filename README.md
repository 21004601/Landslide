# Landslide
 Create a Python program that integrates geological data, precipitation maps, and environmental factors to estimate and forecast landslides in a specific region. This project involves collecting and preprocessing geological and meteorological data, engineering relevant features, and training a machine learning model, such as logistic regression or Random Forests, to predict landslide risk based on historical landslide records and environmental variables. Model performance can be validated using standard metrics, ensuring accurate and actionable landslide estimation and forecasting for the target area, which can be crucial for disaster mitigation and planning.
